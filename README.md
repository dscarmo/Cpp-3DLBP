# 3DLBP

Implementation of 3D LBP in C++ for depth images from:

Y. Huang, Y. Wang, and T. Tan. Combining statistics of geometrical and correlative features for 3d face recognition. In Proceedings of the British Machine Vision Conference, pages 90.1â€“90.10. BMVA Press, 2006. doi:10.5244/C.20.90.

Tested depth images should be in 8 bits (just like in the article). If you find any bug in the implementation, contact me!
